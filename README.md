# MockSAS
This python package allows the creation of profiles of SAS systems for the evaluation of multi-armed bandit policies.
# Explanation
Profiles are specified in the profile folder, a profile of SWIM (a SAS Exemplar) is included. Execution starts from the run.py script through which MAB policies to evaluate are specified. Instead of running run.py with the arguments of the seed and the csv name, these things are called as variables in the run.py code.
